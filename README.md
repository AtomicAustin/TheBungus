IMPORTANT:
I put this up on github so I can more easily switch files between my laptop and desktop, but I also semi-hope this could get some attention and criticism. I don't expect this to be anything anyone wants to play, I'm just doing this to learn so any constructive comments are welcome! If there's any questions about anything feel free to contact me.

PROGRESS:
Beginning- Messing with SFML and getting familiar with the libraries. Very raw and basic movement/collisions. Programmer art

Basics- Need-to-have engines are built or being built. Testing fluid movements and collisions. Small sprite sheets

Early Implementation- Basic engines are finished and being redesigned engines, adding more functionality for a more modular layout. Larger sheets

Building- More advanced engines and collision in development, looking a lot more at optimization. Huge art dump.

DEVELOPMENT:
Need to create art for objects and enemy sprites
Working with the engine that populates the level with enemies/NPCs
Also working on level1 background art
